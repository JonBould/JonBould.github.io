            <p class="faqP"> 3D printing is a modern production process that builds a three dimensional object from a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file. </p>
            <p class="faqP"> The most common method, and the method that we use, is called Fused Deposition Modelling (or FDM).
                    This method stacks layers of material on top of one another at a high temperature so that the material bonds and forms a complete object. </p>

        <button class="RevealButton" onclick="Reveal(material)"><p>What Material Can You Print?</p> <img class="ButtonIcon" src="/Images/Icons/drop.png" alt=""></button>
        <div id="material" class="infoBox" style="display: none;">
            <img id="materialIcon" class="MediumIcon" src="/Images/Icons/questionMark.png">
            <p class="faqP"> We currently stock PLA and PETG which are both great materials to print with that allow for a wide range of uses. </p>
            <p class="faqP">PETG is very durable, more flexible but also a little softer. It is also very strong and has great chemical resistance.
                It is also slightly more expensive than PLA. PLA is slightly easier to print with especially for complex prints that require supports as they will be easier to remove in post.
                However PLA can break down in sunlight as it is biodegradable. </p>
            <p class="faqP"> In short, PLA is a great all rounder, however, if durability is the priority PETG is probably best for you.</p>

            <img id="pluslIcon" class="MediumIcon" src="/Images/Icons/plus.png">
            <p class="faqP"> We can currently print objects up to 220 x 220 x 250mm. </p>
            <p class="faqP"> However we can split objects up into multiple prints to be assembled afterwards. </p>

            <p class="faqP"> A common misconception with 3D printing is that it is extremely fast. The speed of printing is dependent on the size, complexity and required finish of your print.
                However, for a single production the process is much quicker than alternative productions. </p>
            <p class="faqP"> We hope to have your print with you within a week, however express service can be discussed. </p>

            <img id="poundIcon" class="MediumIcon" src="/Images/Icons/pound.png">
            <p class="faqP"> Quotes are calculated on a model to model basis, which considers material, time of print and complexity (as print failures must be kept in mind for complex prints). </p>
